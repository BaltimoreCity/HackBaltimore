    <p class="p__text">Organizations of all sizes in Baltimore City are challenged with attracting and retaining tech talent. There’s no shortage of opportunities around, but outside of, Baltimore City. Resources are drawn to Washington D.C. as demand rises. However, Baltimore City can step up as the human capital hub. <br><br> This is the town that dedicate significant effort to bring up the youth of Baltimore City to build the future. We live in a time where automation is changing the workforce as we know it. Traditional manual labor opportunities are being replaced by high tech opportunities. Let’s build the ecosystem to provide guidance and prepare the next generation for the future.<br><br>With many job opportunities requiring prior experience, it can be challenging for those entering the IT profession to get started and gain the experience needed to demonstrate and develop their abilities.  By providing real world experience, Hack Baltimore is helping to fulfill this critical need in a unique way and grow the pipeline of skilled IT professionals in Baltimore City.
